# Simple Blogging Platform

A basic blogging platform built using Flask, SQLite, HTML, and Bootstrap. This project demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Delete) operations with a simple, responsive UI.

## Features
- Add new blog posts with a title and content.
- View all blog posts in a list(card layout).
- Allows easy deletion of blog posts with a click.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: Python web framework for building the app.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database to store blog posts.
- **Bootstrap**: For simple and responsive front-end design.

## How It Works

- app.py handles the Flask routes for displaying, adding, and deleting blog posts.
- posts.db is an SQLite database to store post data.
- Templates: layout.html provides a base layout, while index.html handles dynamic content using Jinja2.

## âœ¨ Future Improvements

- Add user authentication for secure posting.
- Implement editing functionality for posts.
- Enhance the UI with custom CSS and animations.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Priyapoojary11/Blog_using_Flask.git
